# Pandi_WebDev_Final

Cobuild, is the name of my web app.
The increase trend of buying and selling online in the time of pandemic motivated me to create a web app a platform that allows people to view and post products, etc. online for helping them not lose a livelihood.

What we see in a web app may look simple but the back end is tough and cofusing, web developers really need not only good at designing but also coding.
Alot of things the course have taught me, the people behind a developing a webb app, the lines of codes and definitions to understand to help create a web app.
I need to improve everyhting, this is really just the basics of web developing. What I should do is to try and learn more and more.
