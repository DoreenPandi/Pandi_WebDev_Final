I used the sample demo codes as template and adjusted/added my own, I used nav-item to add fas which is the font awesome icons to the navigation. I re used card titles and card text to add post status, comments, and time it posted, and fas again for icons. form-inline and form-control for adding the search bar. Using col-6 and float for the profile icons and username. I used list-group for the comment section and post button. I repeat the process until I've finished up to total of 9 post/images.
